_TL;DR: TreeDAO was created as a reference for anyone who wants to learn how to make a DAO. It uses OpenZeppelin's audited ERC20, ERC115 and 
Governance contracts behind the scenes in order to have a trustworthy governance structure. Users are able to mint a membership token and if they are 
in the posession of SAP (the governance token), they can vote on - and create - proposals. You can check out the 
full project [here](https://github.com/pietertolsma/TreeDAO)._

**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)** started popping up the last few years as smart contracts became more and more available. DAOs are owned by a group of (anonymous) people that hold 
governance tokens belonging to the organization. The more tokens someone has, the more voting power he/she has in deciding the direction of the organization.

Because this type of organization is starting to catch on, I wanted to figure out how they really work.
For me, the best way to understand something is to just build it. In this post, I will go over 
the architecture and some of the things that I learned during this project.

The learning objectives of this project are:
- Configure and deploy custom smart contracts for the governance structure.
- Write a custom front-end that:
    - Allows users to become a member of TreeDAO
    - Allows owners to vote on proposals
    - Allows owners to create new proposals
    - Allows owners to delegate their votes

## TreeDAO Contracts
This project uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to compile and test the custom contracts and [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to finally deploy it.

**Using widely audited contracts** is a good idea if you want to avoid your fresh DAO becoming the victim of 
[yet another contract hack](https://therecord.media/cryptocurrency-platform-wormhole-hacked-for-an-estimated-322-million/).
For this project, I decided to reuse OpenZeppelin's ERC20, ERC115 and Governance contracts.
They have [a neat contract configuration tool](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) to make it even easier.
It is out of the scope of this post to go deep into what these standards do, but in short;
- [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) gives us a _fungible governance token_ called Sapling that is used to determine ownership.
- [ERC1155](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc1155) gives us a _semi-fungible membership token_. Basically this means that many people can own a specific 'NFT'.
 The advantage of this is that the transactions are cheaper than the most used NFT standard, ERC721.
- The [Governance](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance) contracts are more complicated. It uses an ERC20 token (in our case Sapling)
 to determine voting power. Wallets that contain more than 1% of the total supply are able to create a 
 proposal, which in turn can contain at most 10 transactions. Once the proposal is accepted by the majority,
  someone can execute the proposal, which will atomically execute all transactions within it.
  To make it even more complicated, these transactions are put in a timelock. This will give people who
  do not agree with the proposal time to 'ragequit' out of the DAO. These contracts also make use of checkpoints,
  ensuring that people cannot 'double spend' their votes on a proposal by transfering Sapling tokens after voting.

  _Example: 2 out of 3 members decide to work together and vote to withdraw the entire treasury to their own wallet.
  The 3rd member is able to ragequit the DAO and take 1/3rd of the funds with him before the proposal is executed_

**Testing smart contracts** is a great way to figure out how they function. For this project, I started off 
[writing some tests](https://github.com/pietertolsma/TreeDAO/tree/master/contracts/test) to go through the
entire process of deploying the contracts, creating a proposal, voting and finally executing it.
Because of this, I was quickly able to figure out why I could not create or vote on any proposal; it turned
out that you need to delegate your votes to your own address first in order to force a checkpoint.

## TreeDAO Front-End
For interacting with the contracts, this project uses [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that is quickly
gaining in popularity amongst web developers due to its neat hybrid static server rendering support.

To speed up the development process, [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) is used for quickly getting decent looking 
components.

[Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) "aims to be a complete and compact 
library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem", and it does so 
in a way that is really easy to use. The best thing about first testing the contracts is that the testing code 
can be reused in the front-end part, since it needs to interact with the contract in the exact same way.

**Events** are logged on-chain after most write operations on the contracts. Using events, it is possible to
easily query things like, "find all created proposals", "find all token holders", etc. For example, I wrote
the following code to calculate the current balance of token holders. Please note that this gets very 
resource intensive when you start to get a lot of transactions, but for this demo it is sufficient.

```javascript
const abi = ["event Transfer(address indexed src, address indexed dst, uint val)"]
const contract = new Contract(SAPLING_ADDRESS, abi, provider.getSigner(0))
const eventFilter = await contract.filters.Transfer(null, null);
const events = await contract.queryFilter(eventFilter)
const owners = {}

for (const evt of events) {
    const src = evt.args[0]
    const dst = evt.args[1]
    const amount = parseFloat(ethers.utils.formatEther(evt.args[2]));

    if (parseInt(src) != 0) {
        if (src in owners) {
            owners[src] -= amount;
        } else {
            reject("Sender of SAP had no balance");
        }
    }

    if (parseInt(dst) != 0) {
        if (dst in owners) {
            owners[dst] += amount;
        } else {
            owners[dst] = amount;
        }
    }
}
```

## Final words
Building and interacting with smart contracts has been a fun and rewarding practice so far.
If you are interested in learning more about blockchain development, I can recommend that
you start with any of the [buildspace.so](https://buildspace.so/) free courses. They are a great
way to dip your toe in the water!
